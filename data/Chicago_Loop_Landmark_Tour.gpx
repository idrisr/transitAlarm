    <desc>333 North Michigan Building

Address: 333 N. Michigan Ave.
Year Built: 1928
Architect: Holabird &amp; Roche / Root
Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: February 7, 1997

One of the city's most outstanding Art Deco-style skyscrapers, it is one of four buildings surrounding the Michigan Avenue Bridge that define one of the city's--and nation's--finest urban spaces. The building's base is sheathed in polished granite, in shades of black and purple. Its upper stories, which are set back in dramatic fashion to correspond to the city's 1923 zoning ordinance, are clad in buff-colored limestone and dark terra cotta. The building's prominence is further heightened by its unique site. Due to the jog of Michigan Avenue at the bridge, the building is visible the length of North Michigan Avenue, appearing to be located in the center of the street.</desc>

Corner Clock, photo by CCL This 40-story building was the tallest outside of New York City at the time of its construction. Designed as the "Jeweler's Building," it originally housed a parking garage on the second through 22nd floors. The building's terra cotta-clad, classical design marks it as one of the most prominent high-rise statements of the so-called City Beautiful Movement. It is also the most notable work of the partnership of Joachim Giaver and Frederick Dinkelberg, who had spent most of their architectural careers with the firm of D.H. Burnham &amp; Company.</desc>

Address: 430 S. Michigan Ave.
Year Built: 1886-1890
Architect: Adler &amp; Sullivan
Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: September 15, 1976

The extraordinary engineering talent of Dankmar Adler and the architectural genius of Louis H. Sullivan created this building to reflect the cultural maturity of Chicago. Combining hotel and office space with a splendid theater designed for an opera company, the Auditorium was a turning point in Sullivan's career and a milestone in the development of modern architecture.

Sullivan's genius for architectural ornamentation is displayed in the building's interior, where most of the public rooms are lavishly finished. The grandest interior space is the theater itself, with four broad elliptical arches spanning the width of the theater and decorated by plaster reliefs covered with gold leaf.</desc>

Address: 636 S. Michigan Ave.
Year Built: 1908-1910
Architect: Marshall &amp; Fox
Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: April 29, 1998

Considered the city's best example of a turn-of-the-century luxury hotel, the Blackstone also represents--both its exterior and interior--an excellent and rare example of the Modern French style of Beaux-Arts, (Classical Revival) architecture. Built by prominent hoteliers Tracy and John Drake, the Blackstone became known as the "Hotel of Presidents," serving as host to a dozen U.S. Presidents, including Woodrow Wilson, Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt, and John F. Kennedy. The Blackstone was the location of the famous "smoke-filled rooms" where Warren G. Harding was chosen as the compromise Republican nominee for President in June 1920. (The term, which has since become a political cliche, was coined by a reporter covering the convention.) The hotel was named for Timothy B. Blackstone, a prominent railroad executive and the founding president of the Union Stock Yards, whose mansion had stood on the site.</desc>

Year Built: 1909-1910
Architect: Holabird &amp; Roche
Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: January 14, 1997

A remarkably intact example of a Chicago School-style structure, which was an architectural movement of international importance that developed here between the 1880s and the early 1900s. The building was commissioned by Boston developers Peter and Shepard Brooks, who built many of Chicago's most innovative structures. It was designed by Holabird &amp; Roche, who were instrumental in the so-called Chicago School of architecture. The building, which is notable for its finely detailed orange-brown and green colored terra cotta ornament, large windows, and minimal wall surfaces, epitomizes the early steel-framed skyscraper--a type of structure that Chicago is world renown for having helped create.</desc>

Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: May 9, 1996

According to popular legend, the architects of this building chose its dark green and gold colors based on a gold-foiled champagne bottle seen at an office holiday party. Whether true or not, the resulting color combination and Art Deco-style detailing make it one of the most-distinctive features on the Chicago skyline. The building's lobby also is a classic of Art Deco design, with exceptionally fine bronzework and black marble. The building was designed by Daniel and Hubert Burnham, sons of the legendary architect and city planner Daniel H. Burnham.</desc>

Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: November 5, 1970

One of the most important structures in early modern architecture, famed for its influential modular construction and design. Visionary architect Louis Sullivan shaped this commercial building--originally built for the Schlesinger and Mayer department store--into a dramatically animated structure that inseparably merges beauty and function. The ornament of the lower two stories is frozen in cast iron, while at the same time giving the impression of being in fluid motion. It is an excellent example of Sullivan's genius for architectural ornament.</desc>

Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: January 21, 1982

Chapin and Gore, a liquor distilling firm, commissioned this building to combine its warehouse and office space with a street-level retail store and bar. Working with architect Hugh M. G. Garden, Richard Schmidt demonstrated the aesthetic possibilities of the utilitarian building through the bold exterior expression of interior functions, fine brickwork, and decorative terra cotta. Garden and Schmidt were acknowledged as one of the most progressive architectural firms of the early 20th centrury. The building's ornamental capitals and cornice were removed in the 1950s, but are expected to be restored in 1998.</desc>

One of the city's finest examples of Art Deco architecture, a style of the 1920s and early 1930s that attempted to express the modern, streamlined world by the use of cubic forms, geometric ornament, and sleek surface materials.

The unrelieved verticality of the north facade provides a dramatic termination to LaSalle Street. The two-story lobby is one of the city's finest examples of this period of design.</desc>

An excellent and very visible example of the internationally recognized architectural style known as the Chicago School. The building's features epitomize this style: large "Chicago windows," metal-frame construction, distinctive bays, and terra cotta cladding. The building's designers were one of the firms instrumental in developing the Chicago School. The building is prominently sited on the southwest corner of State and Madison, its visibility heightened by a jog in the alignment of State Street. The building is a critical component of a grouping of significant structures--which include Carson Pirie Scott and the former Mandel Brothers Store--at what was once labeled the "World's Busiest Corner."</desc>

This is the first permanent structure of the city's public library system. Designed to be a grand civic building, its Classical Revival-style exterior appearance and its interior spaces are based on classical Greek and Italian Renaissance precedents. The interior is extensively decorated with mosaics, marbles, bronze, and two stained-glass domes designed by the Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company. The building's architect was the Boston firm that succeeded the office of Henry Hobson Richardson, designer of the Glessner House.</desc>

This Beaux-Arts style Classical Revival building, with its elaborate decoration and grand proportions, was one of the first such buildings in the nation and is the oldest surviving in Chicago. Its upright sign and marquee, alone, serve as an unofficial emblem of the city. Its architects also designed the Uptown Theatre, another Chicago Landmark.</desc>

Since 1853, the governments of Chicago and Cook County have shared three different buildings on this site. The monumental, Classical Revival-style exterior of the present structure, which was designed to be a functional and efficient office building, symbolizes the strength, dignity, and vigor of the governmental functions it contains. The County Building was completed in 1908; City Hall was finished in 1911.</desc>

Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: February 5, 1998

A mixed-use structure, the Civic Opera Building houses both a 3,400-seat auditorium and more than half a million square feet of office and retail space. Its architecture clearly expresses its joint role as a civic monument to culture and commerce. The ornate, French Renaissance Revival-style,

two-story portico and monumental pedestrian colonnade, which face Wacker Drive, are appropriate to the style and use of a grand opera house.

In contrast, the building's Art Deco-style facade facing the Chicago River is shaped like an enormous armchair; its 12-story "seat" is the opera house, its 22-story "arms" are office annexes, and its 45-story "back" is the office tower.

Critics at the time referred to the building as "Insull's throne," in reference to its builder, utility magnate Samuel Insull. The interior of the opera house features a sumptuous lobby and fire curtain, both detailed by noted muralist and designer Jules Guerin.</desc>

Architects: Bennett, Parson &amp; Frost,Jacques Lambert
Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: August 30, 2000

Funded by philanthropist Kate Buckingham in memory of her brother, Buckingham Fountain is one of the nation's finest fountains and a public icon of Chicago. It is the centerpiece of Grant Park, the city's grand "front yard," and is set within a handsomely landscaped garden, one of the city's finest examples of a Beaux-Arts-style landscape design.

The fountain is distinguished not only for its exquisite decorative details and finely wrought bronze sculpture, but also for its innovative use of technology which creates a dynamic light and water display on a massive scale. It is the work of architect-planner Edward H. Bennett, a significant figure in the creation and execution of the 1909 Plan of Chicago, which encouraged the creation of lakefront amenities such as the fountain.

His other works include the Michigan Avenue Bridge, Wacker Drive, and city plans for Detroit, Portland, Ore., Brooklyn, and Ottawa.</desc>

Year Built: 1965, 1967 (Picasso sculpture)
Architects: Pablo Picasso,C.F. Murphy Associates
Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: November 6, 2002

The Daley Center (originally known as the Chicago Civic Center) is an exceptional example of International Style architecture, based on the revolutionary steel and glass skyscrapers of world-famous architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. The building, Chicago's first major public building to be constructed in a modern rather than a classical architectural style, was designed by C. F. Murphy Associates whose work was influential in Chicago during the 1960s and 70s. Innovative for its time are the building's huge spans of steel framing, its exceptional spatial flexibility and the first-ever use of self-weathering Cor-Ten steel as an exterior "skin" for a skyscraper. The building's public spaces remain remarkably intact and are fine examples of International Style interior design. The building's large plaza is ornamented with a fountain and a monumental, enigmatic sculpture fashioned by Pablo Picasso, one of the most influential figures of twentieth century art. The Picasso, unveiled in 1967, is built of Cor-Ten steel similar to that used in the building.</desc>

Construction of this Romanesque Revival-style station symbolized the burgeoning railroad industry in America and Chicago's role as the hub of that industry. As the railroads declined in importance, passenger traffic diminished and operations ceased at this terminal in 1971. After years of neglect, the station began a new life in the mid-1980s as a commercial center, enhancing the surrounding revitalizing community. It is one of the oldest railroad stations in the U.S. and the last remaining of Chicago's early downtown stations. Its designer was a noted New York architect.</desc>

One of the few Loop structures surviving from the massive rebuilding that followed the Fire of 1871, this Italianate-style building is also an early example of the use of a precast concrete facade in Chicago. An 1889 remodeling made it competitive with newer and larger commercial buildings by adding two floors, a dramatic steel-framed interior atrium, and redesigning the first two floors.</desc>

Architect: Adler &amp; Sullivan
Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: July 31, 1996

A modest commercial loft structure, this building represents an irreplaceable link in the chain of work of one of the nation's most important architectural partnerships, that of Louis Sullivan and Dankmar Adler. The building's unornamented design is a precursor to the firm's work on the Auditorium Building, and the use of a cast-iron structural system permits larger window openings than would have been possible through the use of masonry alone. The distinctive, perforated, cast-iron beams on the rear facade, for example, anticipate building design of nearly seven decades later. The building, which was erected by Chicago attorney Wirt Dexter, was initially used as a factory and showroom for R. Deimel &amp; Brothers, a furniture manufacturing firm.</desc>

The vertical profile and stepped silhouette of its facade, together with a sleek two-story lobby, make the Field Building one of the city's most distinctive Art Deco buildings. Built by the estate of department store founder Marshall Field, it was the last major office building completed prior to a two-decade construction hiatus caused by the Great Depression and World War II. Its site formerly was occupied by the Home Insurance Building (1884), a pioneer in metal-frame skyscraper technology.</desc>

Built by the Studebaker company for the assembly and display of their carriages and wagons, this building was converted into studios and theaters for artists and craftsmen in 1898. The renovation involved adding three floors and designing an interior that would reflect the interests of the new tenants. The interior public spaces, including murals on the 10th floor, remain virtually untouched from the 1898 remodeling.</desc>

Cladding this early skyscraper with Gothic-inspired, terra-cotta tracery was not a casual stylistic choice. Its designers looked for inspiration to the early Gothic cathedrals of Europe, which shared common characteristics of tallness and often having more glass than masonry.

Eagles and mythical beasts decorate the upper stories, and aquatic creatures and seashells--a visual pun on the name of the building's original owner, Lucius G. Fisher--are found at the base. A later addition to the north is largely a repetition of the original design, except for the absence of bay windows.</desc>

This group of three buildings takes its name from the northernmost structure which was designed by master architect Louis Sullivan for the Gage Brothers, a hat wholesaler. The facades, which resulted from Sullivan's collaboration with Holabird &amp; Roche, demonstrate two different approaches to the Chicago School, a design movement that led to the creation of modern commercial architecture. The buildings by Holabird &amp; Roche are straightforward, while the facade designed by Sullivan (18 S.) exemplifies his more expressive approach.</desc>

These buildings provide the best remaining example of what the east side of the Loop looked like prior to the skyscraper boom of the 1890s. All three buildings were designed by prominent post-Fire architects, including the city's first registered architect, John Mills Van Osdel. The bottom two floors of the Haskell Building were remodeled in 1896 by master architect Louis Sullivan. The upper floors typify post-Fire architecture, with their distinctive round arches and decorative masonry.</desc>

Robert Morris and Haym Salomon, the civilian patriots who are depicted here standing hand-in-hand with George Washington, were the two principal financers of the American Revolution. In the 1930s, a group of Chicago civic leaders formed an organization to raise funds to erect a suitable monument to these three patriots. Noted sculptor Lorado Taft began the design; it was finished by his associate, Leonard Crunelle. The location of the monument was named for Capt. Nathan Heald, commander of Fort Dearborn from 1810-1812.</desc>

Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: September 27, 2000

This building was built by Otto Young, a wholesale jeweler and real estate investor. Named for Young's son-in-law, Lawrence Heyworth, who supervised the building's construction, the Heyworth historically housed jewelers, watchmakers, and related businesses. It is an unusual and innovative variation on Chicago School design, combining the structurally expressive character of the Chicago School with the decorative appearance of traditional masonry architecture. The building's tapestry-like ornament complements Louis Sullivan's lavish ornament on the adjacent Carson Pirie Scott department store. Its intact decorative cornice is a highly-crafted and rare building feature among Chicago commercial buildings. It was designed by Frederick P. Dinkelberg, an important architect working for one of the largest and most influential architectural firms in the United States in the early 1900s. Other buildings by Dinkelberg include the Railway Exchange Building in Chicago and New York's Flatiron Building. In addition, one of Chicago's finest historic storefronts, designed in 1917 for O'Connor &amp; Goldberg Shoes, remains at 23 E. Madison St.</desc>

This is one of the defining commercial high-rises of the post-World War II era of modern architecture. The use of stainless steel cladding is an eloquent testimony to the corporation that commissioned the building as its headquarters. The placement of all structural columns on the building's perimeter and the consolidation of elevators and other service functions in a separate tower allowed for a highly flexible interior floor layout. It was the first skyscraper to be built in the Loop following the Great Depression of the 1930s. Its principal designers were Bruce Graham and Walter Netsch of the SOM architecture firm.</desc>

Here, in 1889, Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr started what became the most influential social settlement house in America. They began in a then-dilapidated, 33-year-old mansion that had been built by real estate developer Charles J. Hull. By 1907, however, the settlement had grown into a 13-building complex that enveloped the original building. In 1963, the settlement moved from this site, when it was acquired for the new Chicago Circle Campus of the University of Illinois. As a memorial to Jane Addams, the university retained the original Hull-House Residents Dining Hall (dating to 1905) and rebuilt missing portions of the original Hull House.</desc>

A very open exterior, using cast-iron mullions rather than masonry piers in the central bay, and Sullivan's unique stylized floral ornament give this building its special distinction.</desc>

As the oldest remaining buildings in the Loop, this commercial block represents a rare example of what downtown Chicago looked like when it rebuilt from the Fire of 1871. These early-Victorian era buildings exhibit many of the distinctive features of post-Fire architecture, including cast-iron columns, incised stonework, decorative window hoods, and arched window openings. Located just one block from the Chicago River, this intact group of "mercantile loft" structures is one of the last remnants of the city's wholesaling district, an area that was integral to Chicago's status in the late-19th century as the world's largest market for grain, lumber, livestock, and provisions. The early occupants of these buildings represent a compendium of period wholesalers: a tannery and leather dealer, a manufacturer of iron and woodworking machinery, a sandstone company, a steam heating company, mitten and hat manufacturers, and a corner saloon.</desc>

Renowned as one of the nation's most important early examples of skeletal-frame commercial architecture, this building is discussed in every major history of American architecture. A National Historic Landmark, it was designed by William Le Baron Jenney, the so-called "father of the skyscraper." This building was erected by Levi Leiter; later, it was leased by Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. for its flagship department store. It is the city's oldest surviving department store, a type of building that contributed to State Street's development as a retailing thoroughfare. The so-called "first Leiter" building, built in 1879 at Wells and Monroe, was demolished in 1972.</desc>

One of the city's few and best examples of the Beaux Arts-style Classical Revival applied to the design of a tall office building. It is one of four structures that were constructed around the Michigan Avenue Bridge during the 1920s, a cluster of buildings that has helped define one of Chicago's most dramatic and important urban spaces. The other three buildings are 333 N. Michigan, Tribune Tower, and the Wrigley Building. Built by a British insurance company to be its American headquarters, the building's irregular-shaped site was part of the land once occupied by Fort Dearborn (1803-56).</desc>

Year Built: 1891
Architect: William LeBaron Jenney
Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: June 10, 1996

The city's earliest-surviving, steel-frame building, a type of construction that changed modern architecture. It represents one of the high points of its designer, William Le Baron Jenney, who is widely considered to be the "father of the skyscraper." As one of the first structures to be completely clad in terra cotta, it also marks an important step in Chicago's leadership in the development of the architectural terra cotta industry. Its purity of form and delicacy of ornamental detail mark it as one of the most significant visual landmarks of the South Loop. It was built by Mary Ludington to house the American Book Company.</desc>

Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: May 11, 2005

This lavishly detailed skyscraper houses one of ChicagoÂ¿s oldest legitimate theaters, showing high-quality vaudeville, drama and musicals throughout its history. It is in the French Renaissance style with tripartite Chicago-style windows and a richly-detailed terra-cotta facade. After World War II, the theater was renamed for the Shubert family, which operated AmericaÂ¿s largest theatrical production and theater-owning organization. Acts performing here during the theaterÂ¿s history included Sarah Bernhardt, the Marx Brothers, magician Harry Houdini, and the musicals Â¿CarouselÂ¿ and Â¿Hair.Â¿ The theater's lobby and auditorium are beautifully detailed with Classical ornament and moldings.</desc>

The versatility and strength of metal frame construction made the skyscraper possible, as evidenced by this structure, which reached the then-astounding height of 16 stories in 1891. Its architect was a pioneer in the development of tall buildings. The distinctive bay windows provide maximum light to the building's interior spaces, while the combination of a granite (lower three floors) and brick facade (upper stories) help carry and lighten the load of the internal steel framework.</desc>

In this building, an appropriate exterior aesthetic expression for the then-new, steel-framed skyscraper was found. The facade clearly reveals its underlying structure--with broad windows set in a framework of narrow piers and spandrels. Its open and well-lit interior layout, built around a central light court, significantly influenced the design of modern high-rise commercial structures. The building is named for Jacques Marquette, a French Jesuit missionary and explorer who, in 1674-75, wintered in the area that is now Chicago. The lobby is decorated with mosaic panels made by the Tiffany firm and bronze heads of native Americans, animals, and early explorers.</desc>

The Marshall Field and Company Building is the â€˜grand dameâ€™ of Chicago department store buildings, finely designed and detailed in the Classical Revival style. It is significant historically as the longtime headquarters of Marshall Field and Company, one of the nationâ€™s most historically important retail enterprises, and as one of the finest historic department store buildings in the nation. Built in stages over a generation, the building is the work of one of Chicagoâ€™s leading architects, Daniel H. Burnham; Charles Atwood, a designer in Burnhamâ€™s firm during the early 1890s; Burnhamâ€™s later firm, D.H. Burnham &amp; Company; and its successor firm after Burnhamâ€™s death, Graham, Burnham, &amp; Co. The building is noteworthy for its lavish interiors, including two atria decorated with stained glass and Tiffany mosaics, plus the much-loved Walnut Room.</desc>

 	 Address: 75 E. Wacker Dr.
Year Built: 1928
Architect: Herbert Hugh Riddle
Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: March 7, 2001

This building is Chicago's most slender skyscraper, a "Jazz Age" silhouette against the city's dramatic skyline. Clad in Gothic-inspired terra cotta, Mather Tower is one of Chicago's finest "Modernistic" skyscrapers, combining modern form with lush historic ornament both in its exterior and interior. The form of this "needle" skyscraper was encouraged by the 1923 Chicago Zoning Ordinance which called for tall, slender, "setback" towers. Mather Tower's design-a tower with many shallow setbacks rising to a height of over 500 feet-epitomizes the verticality possible under this pioneering zoning ordinance.</desc>

The two halves of this building provide a unique perspective for examining the history and development of modern architecture. The north part--famed for its lack of traditional ornamentation--is a masonry, wall-bearing structure, the last skyscraper to employ this method of construction, with six-foot thick walls at the base. The south addition, on the other hand, is an early example of steel-frame construction, its underlying structure revealed through narrow piers and wide windows. Together, they mark the end of one building tradition and the beginning of another.</desc>

Year Built: 1893-1894, , 1898, 1903
Architect: Jenney &amp; Mundie
Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: July 6, 2006

This building is the work of Jenney &amp; Mundie, whose senior partner, William Le Baron Jenney, was one of the Cityâ€™s most important 19th-century architects. It is an important surviving example of early Chicago School high-rise construction. It is one of the oldest buildings on LaSalle Street, historically the center of finance and banking in Chicago. Its terra-cotta facade is an excellent example of Classical Revival-style architecture, while its marble-clad lobby is one of downtown Chicagoâ€™s most visually distinctive historic lobbies. The building was built in stages, with the original 12-story building facing LaSalle St. built in 1893-94. In 1898, a 13-story addition was built east of the original building, which received a one-story rooftop addition. Then, in 1903, an additional 14th floor was added to the entire building.</desc>

Rounded corner bays, a feature of many early skyscrapers, enliven the silhouette of this commercial structure. Continuous vertical piers divide the building's long Dearborn Street facade into tall, narrow sections, while continuous horizontal spandrels serve to visually widen the narrow Van Buren Street facade.

The building is a major contributor to LaSalle Street's reputation as one of the city's premier architectural corridors. It is one of the best surviving examples of the work of architects Vitzhum and Burns, who were known for their design of banks and churches.

The 38-story Pittsfield Building is one of downtown Chicago's most distinctive skyscraper designs. The city's tallest building at the time of its completion, the building was designed by Graham, Anderson, Probst and White, one of the city's most distinguished architectural firms during the 1910s and 20s.The building's handsome design, combining both Art Deco and Gothic detailing, is a creative response to the city's 1923 zoning ordinance which encouraged skyscrapers with setback towers. The interior of the building features an outstanding five-story atrium embellished by glowing marbles, gleaming brasses and carvings in a Spanish Gothic style.</desc>

To Chicagoans of the 1890s, the glass-covered exterior of this building seemed to almost defy gravity. A century later, it is internationally recognized as the direct ancestor of today's glass-and-steel skyscrapers. Extremely narrow piers, mullions, and spandrels, all covered with cream-colored terra cotta decorated with Gothic-style tracery, divide wide expanses of glass and clearly delineate the interior steel framework that supports the building. The light and airy facade is almost entirely windows--both flat and projecting bays--of the type known as a "Chicago window:" a wide fixed pane with narrow movable sash windows flanking it. A flat cornice tops the 14-story structure. The severely deteriorated exterior was completely restored by the City of Chicago in 1996.</desc>

Architects: Frank Lloyd Wright, Burnham &amp; Root
Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: July 5, 1972

The powerful exterior of this building, which is softened by lively ornament detailed by architect John Root, typifies the lingering picturesque attitudes toward commercial architecture still prevalent in the 1880s. A transitional structure in the evolution of modern architecture, the Rookery Building employs both masonry wall-bearing and skeletal frame construction techniques. It takes its name from a temporary City Hall and water tank that stood on the site following the Fire of 1871. A favorite roost for pigeons, these structures were referred to as "the rookery." When Frank Lloyd Wright remodeled the Rookery's large skylit lobby in 1905, he introduced elements characteristic of his Prairie School designs.</desc>

Address: 151-199 N. Desplaines St.
Year Built: 1886
Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: March 25, 1991

A decade of strife between labor and industry culminated here in a confrontation that resulted in the tragic death of both workers and policemen. On May 4, 1886, spectators at a labor rally had gathered around the mouth of Crane's Alley (east side of Desplaines, just north of Randolph), named for an industrial plant that stands east of the site. A contingent of police approaching on Desplaines Street were met by a bomb thrown from just south of the alley. The resultant trial of eight activists gained worldwide attention for the labor movement, and initiated the tradition of "May Day" labor rallies in many cities.</desc>

Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: May 26, 2004

This site honors two persons from Chicagoâ€™s early history. John Jones was the undisputed leader of Chicagoâ€™s black community from the 1850s through the 1870s and rose to national prominence as an abolitionist, civil rights activist, and the first African-American to hold elected office in Cook County. John and his wife Mary Jones were central figures in the abolitionist movement, using their home on Edina Place (now South Plymouth Court) as a â€˜stationâ€™ on the Underground Railroad to help fugitive slaves find freedom.</desc>

Address: Dekoven and Jefferson Streets
Year Built: Fire started on October 8, 1871; Sculpture erected, 1961
Architect: Egon Weiner
Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: September 15, 1971

Sometime between 8:45 and 9:30, on the night of October 8, 1871, a fire started in a barn owned by Catherine and Patrick O'Leary on DeKoven Street, 1-1/2 miles southwest of the downtown. Fanned by a strong wind, in a city largely built of wood structures, the blaze raged for nearly 30 hours. Flames spread as far as the city's northern limits (near Fullerton Avenue) before finally dying out in the early morning rain of Tuesday, October 10. Much of the downtown and surrounding areas lay in ruins; 300 were dead and a third of the city's population of 300,000 was left homeless. Ironically and appropriately, Chicago's Fire Department Training Academy stands on the site.</desc>

Address: Southeast Corner of Lake Street and Wacker Drive
Year Built: Sauganash built 1831, destroyed 1851; Wigwam built 1860, destroyed 1867
Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: November 6, 2002

The Site of the Sauganash Hotel/Wigwam is important in the history of Chicago's early development. Mark Beaubien built the Sauganash Hotel in 1831 at Wolf Point, on the east bank of the south branch of the Chicago River at the "forks" of the River where the north and south branches meet. It was at the Sauganash Hotel in 1833 that the newly-formed Town of Chicago voted to elected its first town trustees and where many of the town meetings occurred. During a brief period in 1837 when the building was not in operation as a hotel, it served as Chicago's first theater. The Sauganash Hotel remained in almost continuous operation until it burned down in 1851.

The Wigwam, constructed on the same site nine years later, was home to the 1860 Republican National Convention. It was at this historic convention that Abraham Lincoln was nominated as the Republican candidate for president. His nomination and eventual election as the nation's 16th President triggered a series of dramatic events surrounding the abolition of slavery and the secession of several southern states, ultimately culminating in the Civil War. His powerful leadership skills are credited with having led the country successfully through perhaps its darkest time.</desc>

Year Built: 1929
Architect: Karl M. Vitzthum
Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: July 26, 2006

This is one of Chicagoâ€™s most visually striking, 1920s-era skyscrapers in Chicago. Designed in the Gothic Revival architectural style, the building is an outstanding example of a terra-cotta-clad skyscraper, ornamented with a plethora of Gothic ornament, including pointed arches, tracery, finials, and flying buttresses. The Building was designed by Karl M. Vitzthum, one of Chicagoâ€™s significant early twentieth-century architects and the designer of the One North LaSalle Building (a designated Chicago Landmark), as well as a number of distinctive neighborhood bank buildings throughout Chicago.</desc>

Year Built: 1929-1930
Architects: Edgar Miller, Thielbard &amp; Fugard,Eugene and Gwen Lux
Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: January 14, 2004

One of downtown Chicago's most distinctive "Jazz Age" skyscrapers, this building is handsomely clad with variegated brick that lightens from deep red to lighter yellow-red from base to crown. The building's distinctive stepped-back top with terra-cotta crown reflects the influence of the 1923 Chicago zoning ordinance. The building is embellished with a variety of art works, including low-relief limestone sculpures by husband-and-wife artists Eugene and Gwen Lux that depict allegorical scenes in the history of banking and commerce. In addition, artist Edgar Miller designed the cut-lead decorative screen ornamenting one of the building's entrances on Lake St. The building's public lobbies are richly ornamented with deeply-colored marbles.</desc>

Built during the time when Chicago reigned as the undisputed rail center of the United States, Union Station handled as many as 300 trains and 100,000 passengers daily. Upon its completion Union Station was hailed as an outstanding achievement in railroad facility planning and is one of the most historically significant passenger railroad stations in the United States. Today the monumental Neoclassical station is the last-remaining great railroad terminal still in use in Chicago. The station's ornate Beaux-Arts main waiting room, the "Great Hall," is one of the United States' great interior public spaces with its vaulted skylight and connecting lobbies, staircases, and balconies.</desc>

Address: 40 N. Wells St.
Year Built: 1873-1874
Architect: Frederick and Edward Baumann
Date Designated a Chicago Landmark: January 14, 1997

At the time of its construction, in the aftermath of the Fire of 1871, the Washington Block was one of the tallest buildings in the city. It is a critical link to understanding the evolution of the Chicago skyscraper, a rare surviving example of the use of the "isolated pier foundation," which was an engineering advancement that helped develop the high-rise office building. The ornate detailing of its virtually intact limestone facades makes the Washington Block a building of individual architectural distinction. The building originally featured an outside staircase that led to an ornate, second-floor corner entrance. The lobby still includes a rare example of a curving hardwood staircase.</desc>
